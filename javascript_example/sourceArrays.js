bee = "LILACS   Lilacs,   False blue,   White,   Purple,   Color of lilac,   Your great puffs of flowers   Are everywhere in this my New England.   Among your heart-shaped leaves   Orange orioles hop like music-box birds and sing   Their little weak soft songs;   In the crooks of your branches   The bright eyes of song sparrows sitting on spotted eggs   Peer restlessly through the light and shadow   Of all Springs.   Lilacs in dooryards   Holding quiet conversations with an early moon;   Lilacs watching a deserted house   Settling sideways into the grass of an old road;   Lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a lopsided shock of bloom   Above a cellar dug into a hill.   You are everywhere.   You were everywhere.   You tapped the window when the preacher preached his sermon,   And ran along the road beside the boy going to school.   You stood by pasture-bars to give the cows good milking,   You persuaded the housewife that her dish-pan was of silver   And her husband an image of pure gold.   You flaunted the fragrance of your blossoms   Through the wide doors of Custom Houses--   You, and sandal-wood, and tea,   Charging the noses of quill-driving clerks   When a ship was in from China.   You called to them: 'Goose-quill men, goose-quill men,   May is a month for flitting,'   Until they writhed on their high stools   And wrote poetry on their letter-sheets behind the propped-up         ledgers.   Paradoxical New England clerks,   Writing inventories in ledgers, reading the 'Song of Solomon' at         night,   So many verses before bedtime,   Because it was the Bible.   The dead fed you   Amid the slant stones of graveyards.   Pale ghosts who planted you   Came in the night time   And let their thin hair blow through your clustered stems.   You are of the green sea,   And of the stone hills which reach a long distance.   You are of elm-shaded streets with little shops where they sell         kites and marbles,   You are of great parks where every one walks and nobody is at home.   You cover the blind sides of greenhouses   And lean over the top to say a hurry-word through the glass   To your friends, the grapes, inside.   Lilacs,   False blue,   White,   Purple,   Color of lilac,   You have forgotten your Eastern origin,   The veiled women with eyes like panthers,   The swollen, aggressive turbans of jeweled Pashas.   Now you are a very decent flower,   A reticent flower,   A curiously clear-cut, candid flower,   Standing beside clean doorways,   Friendly to a house-cat and a pair of spectacles,   Making poetry out of a bit of moonlight   And a hundred or two sharp blossoms.   Maine knows you,   Has for years and years;   New Hampshire knows you,   And Massachusetts   And Vermont.   Cape Cod starts you along the beaches to Rhode Island;   Connecticut takes you from a river to the sea.   You are brighter than apples,   Sweeter than tulips,   You are the great flood of our souls   Bursting above the leaf-shapes of our hearts,   You are the smell of all Summers,   The love of wives and children,   The recollection of the gardens of little children,   You are State Houses and Charters   And the familiar treading of the foot to and fro on a road it knows.   May is lilac here in New England,   May is a thrush singing 'Sun up!' on a tip-top ash-tree,   May is white clouds behind pine-trees   Puffed out and marching upon a blue sky.   May is a green as no other,   May is much sun through small leaves,   May is soft earth,   And apple-blossoms,   And windows open to a South wind.   May is a full light wind of lilac   From Canada to Narragansett Bay.   Lilacs,   False blue,   White,   Purple,   Color of lilac,   Heart-leaves of lilac all over New England,   Roots of lilac under all the soil of New England,   Lilac in me because I am New England,   Because my roots are in it,   Because my leaves are of it,   Because my flowers are for it,   Because it is my country   And I speak to it of itself   And sing of it with my own voice   Since certainly it is mine.   TWENTY-FOUR HOKKU ON A MODERN THEME         I   Again the larkspur,   Heavenly blue in my garden.   They, at least, unchanged.         II   How have I hurt you?   You look at me with pale eyes,   But these are my tears.         III   Morning and evening--   Yet for us once long ago   Was no division.         IV   I hear many words.   Set an hour when I may come   Or remain silent.         V   In the ghostly dawn   I write new words for your ears--   Even now you sleep.         VI   This then is morning.   Have you no comfort for me   Cold-colored flowers?         VII   My eyes are weary   Following you everywhere.   Short, oh short, the days!         VIII   When the flower falls   The leaf is no more cherished.   Every day I fear.         IX   Even when you smile   Sorrow is behind your eyes.   Pity me, therefore.         X   Laugh--it is nothing.   To others you may seem gay,   I watch with grieved eyes.         XI   Take it, this white rose.   Stems of roses do not bleed;   Your fingers are safe.         XII   As a river-wind   Hurling clouds at a bright moon,   So am I to you.         XIII   Watching the iris,   The faint and fragile petals--   How am I worthy?         XIV   Down a red river   I drift in a broken skiff.   Are you then so brave?         XV   Night lies beside me   Chaste and cold as a sharp sword.   It and I alone.         XVI   Last night it rained.   Now, in the desolate dawn,   Crying of blue jays.         XVII   Foolish so to grieve,   Autumn has its colored leaves--   But before they turn?         XVIII   Afterwards I think:   Poppies bloom when it thunders.   Is this not enough?         XIX   Love is a game--yes?   I think it is a drowning:   Black willows and stars.         XX   When the aster fades   The creeper flaunts in crimson.   Always another!         XXI   Turning from the page,   Blind with a night of labor,   I hear morning crows.         XXII   A cloud of lilies,   Or else you walk before me.   Who could see clearly?         XXIII   Sweet smell of wet flowers   Over an evening garden.   Your portrait, perhaps?         XXIV   Staying in my room,   I thought of the new Spring leaves.   That day was happy.   THE SWANS   The swans float and float   Along the moat   Around the Bishop's garden,   And the white clouds push   Across a blue sky   With edges that seem to draw in and harden.   Two slim men of white bronze   Beat each with a hammer on the end of a rod   The hours of God.   Striking a bell,   They do it well.   And the echoes jump, and tinkle, and swell   In the Cathedral's carved stone polygons.   The swans float   About the moat,   And another swan sits still in the air   Above the old inn.   He gazes into the street   And swims the cold and the heat,   He has always been there,   At least so say the cobbles in the square.   They listen to the beat   Of the hammered bell,   And think of the feet   Which beat upon their tops;   But what they think they do not tell.   And the swans who float   Up and down the moat   Gobble the bread the Bishop feeds them.   The slim bronze men beat the hour again,   But only the gargoyles up in the hard blue air heed them.   When the Bishop says a prayer,   And the choir sing 'Amen,'   The hammers break in on them there:   Clang! Clang! Beware! Beware!   The carved swan looks down at the passing men,   And the cobbles wink: 'An hour has gone again.'   But the people kneeling before the Bishop's chair   Forget the passing over the cobbles in the square.   An hour of day and an hour of night,   And the clouds float away in a red-splashed light.   The sun, quotha? or white, white   Smoke with fire all alight.   An old roof crashing on a Bishop's tomb,   Swarms of men with a thirst for room,   And the footsteps blur to a shower, shower, shower,   Of men passing--passing--every hour,   With arms of power, and legs of power,   And power in their strong, hard minds.   No need then   For the slim bronze men   Who beat God's hours: Prime, Tierce, None.   Who wants to hear? No one.   We will melt them, and mold them,   And make them a stem   For a banner gorged with blood,   For a blue-mouthed torch.   So the men rush like clouds,   They strike their iron edges on the Bishop's chair   And fling down the lanterns by the tower stair.   They rip the Bishop out of his tomb   And break the mitre off of his head.   'See,' say they, 'the man is dead;   He cannot shiver or sing.   We'll toss for his ring.'   The cobbles see this all along the street   Coming--coming--on countless feet.   And the clockmen mark the hours as they go.   But slow--slow--   The swans float   In the Bishop's moat.   And the inn swan   Sits on and on,   Staring before him with cold glass eyes.   Only the Bishop walks serene,   Pleased with his church, pleased with his house,   Pleased with the sound of the hammered bell,   Beating his doom.   Saying 'Boom! Boom! Room! Room!'   He is old, and kind, and deaf, and blind,   And very, very pleased with his charming moat   And the swans which float.   PRIME   Your voice is like bells over roofs at dawn   When a bird flies   And the sky changes to a fresher color.   Speak, speak, Beloved.   Say little things   For my ears to catch   And run with them to my heart.   VESPERS   Last night, at sunset,   The foxgloves were like tall altar candles.   Could I have lifted you to the roof of the greenhouse, my Dear,   I should have understood their burning.   IN EXCELSIS   You--you--   Your shadow is sunlight on a plate of silver;   Your footsteps, the seeding-place of lilies;   Your hands moving, a chime of bells across a windless air.   The movement of your hands is the long, golden running of light from         a rising sun;   It is the hopping of birds upon a garden-path.   As the perfume of jonquils, you come forth in the morning.   Young horses are not more sudden than your thoughts,   Your words are bees about a pear-tree,   Your fancies are the gold-and-black striped wasps buzzing among red         apples.   I drink your lips,   I eat the whiteness of your hands and feet.   My mouth is open,   As a new jar I am empty and open.   Like white water are you who fill the cup of my mouth,   Like a brook of water thronged with lilies.   You are frozen as the clouds,   You are far and sweet as the high clouds.   I dare reach to you,   I dare touch the rim of your brightness.   I leap beyond the winds,   I cry and shout,   For my throat is keen as a sword   Sharpened on a hone of ivory.   My throat sings the joy of my eyes,   The rushing gladness of my love.   How has the rainbow fallen upon my heart?   How have I snared the seas to lie in my fingers   And caught the sky to be a cover for my head?   How have you come to dwell with me,   Compassing me with the four circles of your mystic lightness,   So that I say 'Glory! Glory!' and bow before you   As to a shrine?   Do I tease myself that morning is morning and a day after?   Do I think the air a condescension,   The earth a politeness,   Heaven a boon deserving thanks?   So you--air--earth--heaven--   I do not thank you,   I take you,   I live.   And those things which I say in consequence   Are rubies mortised in a gate of stone.   LA RONDE DU DIABLE   'Here we go round the ivy-bush,'   And that's a tune we all dance to.   Little poet people snatching ivy,   Trying to prevent one another from snatching ivy.   If you get a leaf, there's another for me;   Look at the bush.   But I want your leaf, Brother, and you mine,   Therefore, of course, we push.   'Here we go round the laurel-tree.'   Do we want laurels for ourselves most,   Or most that no one else shall have any?   We cannot stop to discuss the question.   We cannot stop to plait them into crowns   Or notice whether they become us.   We scarcely see the laurel-tree,   The crowd about us is all we see,   And there's no room in it for you and me.   Therefore, Sisters, it's my belief   We've none of us very much chance at a leaf.   'Here we go round the barberry-bush.'   It's a bitter, blood-red fruit at best,   Which puckers the mouth and burns the heart.   To tell the truth, only one or two   Want the berries enough to strive   For more than he has, more than she.   An acid berry for you and me.   Abundance of berries for all who will eat,   But an aching meat.   That's poetry.   And who wants to swallow a mouthful of sorrow?   The world is old and our century   Must be well along, and we've no time to waste.   Make haste, Brothers and Sisters, push   With might and main round the ivy-bush,   Struggle and pull at the laurel-tree,   And leave the barberries be   For poor lost lunatics like me,   Who set them so high   They overtop the sun in the sky.   Does it matter at all that we don't know why?   ROBERT FROST   FIRE AND ICE   Some say the world will end in fire,     Some say in ice.   From what I've tasted of desire   I hold with those who favor fire.     But if it had to perish twice,   I think I know enough of hate     To know that for destruction ice   Is also great,     And would suffice.   THE GRINDSTONE   Having a wheel and four legs of its own   Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone   To get it anywhere that I can see.   These hands have helped it go and even race;   Not all the motion, though, they ever lent,   Not all the miles it may have thought it went,   Have got it one step from the starting place.   It stands beside the same old apple tree.   The shadow of the apple tree is thin   Upon it now; its feet are fast in snow.   All other farm machinery's gone in,   And some of it on no more legs and wheel   Than the grindstone can boast to stand or go.   (I'm thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow.)   For months it hasn't known the taste of steel,   Washed down with rusty water in a tin.   But standing outdoors, hungry, in the cold,   Except in towns, at night, is not a sin.   And, anyway, its standing in the yard   Under a ruinous live apple tree   Has nothing any more to do with me,   Except that I remember how of old,   One summer day, all day I drove it hard,   And some one mounted on it rode it hard,   And he and I between us ground a blade.   I gave it the preliminary spin,   And poured on water (tears it might have been);   And when it almost gayly jumped and flowed,   A Father-Time-like man got on and rode,   Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed.   He turned on will-power to increase the load   And slow me down--and I abruptly slowed,   Like coming to a sudden railroad station.   I changed from hand to hand in desperation.   I wondered what machine of ages gone   This represented an improvement on.   For all I knew it may have sharpened spears   And arrowheads itself. Much use for years   Had gradually worn it an oblate   Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait,   Appearing to return me hate for hate.   (But I forgive it now as easily   As any other boyhood enemy   Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere.)   I wondered who it was the man thought ground--   The one who held the wheel back or the one   Who gave his life to keep it going round?   I wondered if he really thought it fair"

casey = "In the beginning, two thousand years before the heaven and the earth, seven things were created: the Torah written with black fire on white fire, and lying in the lap of God; the Divine Throne, erected in the heaven which later was over the heads of the Hayyot; Paradise on the right side of God, Hell on the left side; the Celestial Sanctuary directly in front of God, having a jewel on its altar graven with the Name of the Messiah, and a Voice that cries aloud, 'Return, ye children of men.' When God resolved upon the creation of the world, He took counsel with the Torah. Her advice was this: 'O Lord, a king without an army and without courtiers and attendants hardly deserves the name of king, for none is nigh to express the homage due to him.' The answer pleased God exceedingly. Thus did He teach all earthly kings, by His Divine example, to undertake naught without first consulting advisers. The advice of the Torah was given with some reservations. She was skeptical about the value of an earthly world, on account of the sinfulness of men, who would be sure to disregard her precepts. But God dispelled her doubts. He told her, that repentance had been created long before, and sinners would have the opportunity of mending their ways. Besides, the Temple service would be invested with atoning power, and Paradise and hell were intended to do duty as reward and punishment. Finally, the Messiah was appointed to bring salvation, which would put an end to all sinfulness. Nor is this world inhabited by man the first of things earthly created by God. He made several worlds before ours, but He destroyed them all, because He was pleased with none until He created ours. But even this last world would have had no permanence, if God had executed His original plan of ruling it according to the principle of strict justice. It was only when He saw that justice by itself would undermine the world that He associated mercy with justice, and made them to rule jointly. Thus, from the beginning of all things prevailed Divine goodness, without which nothing could have continued to exist. If not for it, the myriads of evil spirits had soon put an end to the generations of men. But the goodness of God has ordained, that in every Nisan, at the time of the spring equinox, the seraphim shall approach the world of spirits, and intimidate them so that they fear to do harm to men. Again, if God in His goodness had not given protection to the weak, the tame animals would have been extirpated long ago by the wild animals. In Tammuz, at the time of the summer solstice, when the strength of behemot is at its height, he roars so loud that all the animals hear it, and for a whole year they are affrighted and timid, and their acts become less ferocious than their nature is. Again, in Tishri, at the time of the autumnal equinox, the great bird ziz flaps his wings and utters his cry, so that the birds of prey, the eagles and the vultures, blench, and they fear to swoop down upon the others and annihilate them in their greed. And, again, were it not for the goodness of God, the vast number of big fish had quickly put an end to the little ones. But at the time of the winter solstice, in the month of Tebet, the sea grows restless, for then leviathan spouts up water, and the big fish become uneasy. They restrain their appetite, and the little ones escape their rapacity. Finally, the goodness of God manifests itself in the preservation of His people Israel. It could not have survived the enmity of the Gentiles, if God had not appointed protectors for it, the archangels Michael and Gabriel. Whenever Israel disobeys God, and is accused of misdemeanors by the angels of the other nations, he is defended by his designated guardians, with such good result that the other angels conceive fear of them. Once the angels of the other nations are terrified, the nations themselves venture not to carry out their wicked designs against Israel. That the goodness of God may rule on earth as in heaven, the Angels of Destruction are assigned a place at the far end of the heavens, from which they may never stir, while the Angels of Mercy encircle the Throne of God, at His behest."
